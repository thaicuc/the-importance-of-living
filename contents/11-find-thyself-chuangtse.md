# Find Thyself - Chuangtse

In modern life, a philosopher is about the most honored and most unnoticed
person in the world, if indeed such a person exists. "Philosopher" has become
merely a term of social compliment. Anyone who is abstruse and unintelligible is
called "a philosopher". Anyone who is unconcerned with the present is also
called "a philosopher". And yet there is some truth with the latter meaning.
When Shakespeare made Touchstone say in ***As You Like It***: "Hast any 
philosophy in thee, shepherd?", he was using it in the second meaning. In this 
sense, philosophy is but a common, rough and ready outlook on things or on life 
in general, and every person has more or less of it. Anyone who refuses to take 
the entire panorama of reality on its surface value, or refuses to believe every
word that appears in a newspaper, is more or less a philosopher. He is the
fellow who refuses to be taken in.

There is always a flavor of disenchantment about philosophy. The philosopher
looks at life as an artist looks at a landscape through a veil or a haze. The
raw details of reality are softened a little to permit us to see its meaning. At
least that is what a Chinese artist or a Chinese philosopher thinks. The
philosopher is therefore the direct opposite of the complete realist who, busily
occupied in his daily business, believes that his successes and failures, his
losses and gains, are absolute and real. There is nothing to be done about such
a person because he does not even doubt and there is nothing in him to start
with. As Confucius said:

> If a person does not say to himself "What to do? What to do?" indeed I do not
> know what to do with such a person!

I hope to present in this chapter some opinions of Chinese philosophers on a
design for living. The more these philosophers differ, the more they agree that
man must be wise and unafraid to live a happy life. The more positive Mencian
outlook and the more roguishly pacifist Laotsean outlook merge together in the
Philosophy of the Half-and-Half, which I may describe as the average Chinaman's
religion. The conflict between action and inaction ends in a compromise, or
contentment with a very imperfect heaven on earth. This gives rise to a wise and
merry philosophy of living, eventually typified in the life of T'ao Yuanming, in
my opinion China's greatest poet and most harmonious personality.

The only problem unconsciously assumed by all Chinese philosophers to be of any
importance is: how shall we enjoy life, and who can best enjoy life? No
perfectionism, no straining after the unattainable, no postulating of the
unknowable; but taking poor, mortal human nature as it is, how shall we organize
our life that we can work peacefully, endure nobly and live happily?

Who are we? That is the first question. It is a question almost impossible to
answer. But we all agree that the busy self occupied in our daily activities is
not quite the real self. We are quite sure we have lost something in the mere
pursuit of living. When we watch a person running about looking for something in
a field, the wise man can set a puzzle for all the spectators to solve: what has
that person lost? Some one thinks it is a watch; another thinks it is a diamond
brooch; and others will essay other guesses. After all these guesses have
failed, the wise man who really doesn't know what the person is seeking after
tells the company: "I'll tell you. He has lost some breath." And no one can deny
that he is right. So we often forget our true self in the pursuit of living,
like a bird forgetting its own danger in pursuit of a mantis, which again
forgets its own danger in pursuit of another prey, as is so beautifully
expressed in a parable by Chuangtse:

> When Chuangtse was wandering in the park at Tiao-ling, he saw a strange bird
> which came from the South. Its wings were seven feet across. Its eyes were an
> inch in circumference. And it flew close past Chuangtse's head to alight a
> chestnut grove. "What manner of bird is this?" cried Chuangtse. "With strong
> wings it does not fly away. With large eyes it does not see."  
>  
> So he picked up his skirts and strode towards it with his cross-bow, anxious
> to get a shot. Just then he saw a cicada enjoying itself in the shade,
> forgetful of all else. And he saw a mantis spring and seize it, forgetting in
> the act its own body, which the strange bird immediately pounced upon and made
> its prey. And this it was which had caused the bird to forget  its own nature.  
>  
> "Alas!" cried Chuangtse with a sigh, "How creatures injure one another. Loss
> follows the pursuit of gain."  
>  
> So he laid aside his bow and went home, driven away by the park-keeper who
> wanted to know what business he had there.  
>  
> For three months after this, Chuangtse did not leave the house; and at length
> Lin Chu asked him, saying, "Master, how is it that you have not been out for
> so long?"  
>  
> "While keeping my physical frame", replied Chuangtse, "I lost sight of my real
> self. Gazing at muddy water, I lost sight of the clear abyss. Besides, I have
> learnt from the Master as follows: 'When you go into the world, follow its
> customs.' Now when I strolled into the park at Tiao-ling, I forgot my real
> self. That strange bird which flew close past me to the chestnut grove, forgot
> its nature. The keeper of the chestnut grove took me for a thief. Consequently
> I have not been out."

Chuangtse was the eloquent follower of Laotse, as Menius was the eloquent
follower of Confucius, both separated from their masters by about a century.
Chuangtse was a contemporary of Mencius, as Laotse was probly a contemporary of
Confucius. But Mencius agreed with Chuangtse that we have lost something and the
business of philosophy is to discover and recover that which is lost, in this
case, "a child's heart", according to Mencius. "A great man is he who has not
lost the heart of a child." says this philosopher. Mencius regards the effect of
the artificial life of civilization upon the youthful heart born in man as
similar to the deforestation of our hills:

> There was once a time when the forests of the Niu Mountain were beautiful. But
> can the mountain any longer be regarded as beautiful, since being situated
> near a big city, the woodsmen have hewed the trees down? The days and nights
> gave it rest, and the rains and the dew continued to nourish it, and a new
> life was continually springing up from the soil, but then the castle and the
> sheep began to pasture upon it. That is why the Niu Mountain looks so bald,
> and when people see its baldness, they imagine that there was never any timber
> on the mountain. Is this the true nature of the mountain? And is there not a
> heart of love and kindness in man, too? But how can that nature remain
> beautiful when it is hacked down every day, as the woodsman chops down the
> trees with his ax? To be sure, the nights and days do the healing and there is
> the nourishing are of the early dawn, which tends to keep him sound and
> normal, but this morning air is thin and is soon destroyed by what he does in
> the day. With this continuous hacking of the human spirit, the rest and
> recuperation obtained during the night are not sufficient to maintain its
> level, and then the man suffers himself and others. But is this the true
> nature of man?
