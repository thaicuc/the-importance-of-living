# On Being Mortal

I suspect that all democracy, all poetry, and all philosophy start out from this
God-given fact that all of us, princes and paupers alike, are limited to a body
of five or six feet and live a life of fifty or sixty years. On the whole, the
arrangement is quite handy. We are neither too long nor too short. At least I am
quite satisfied with five feed four. And fifty or sixty years seems to me such
an awfully long time; it is, in fact, a matter of two or three generations. It
is so arranged that when we are born, we see certain old grandfathers, who die
in the course of time, and when we become grandfathers ourselves, we see other
tiny tots being born. That seems to make it just perfect. The whole philosophy
of the matter lies in the Chinese saying that "A man may own a thousand arces of
land, and yet he still sleeps upon a bed of five feet." It doesn't seem as if a
king needed very much more than seven feet at the outside for his bed, and there
he will have to go and stretch himself at night. I am therefore as good as a
king. And no matter how rich a man is, few exceed the Biblical limit of
threescore and ten. To live beyond seventy is to be called in Chinese
"ancient-rare", because of the Chinese line that "It is rare for man to live
over seventy since the ancient times."

And so in respect of wealth. Of this life, everybody has a share, but no one
owns the mortgage. And so we are enabled to take this life more lightly; instead
of being permanent tenants upon this earth, we become its transient guests, for
guests we all are of this earth, the owners of the land no less than
share-croppers. It takes something out of the meaning of the world "landlord".
No one really owns a house and no one really owns a field. As a Chinese poet
says:

> What pretty, golden fields against a hill!  
> Newcomers harvest crops that others till.  
> Rejoice not, O newcomers, at your harvest;  
> One waits behind, a newcomer still!

The democracy of death is seldom appreciated. Without death, even St. Helena
would have meant nothing to Napoleon, and I do not know what Europe would be
like. There would be no biographics of heroes or conquerors, and even if there
were, their biographers certainly would be less forgiving and sympathetic. We
forgive the great of this world because they are dead. By their being dead, we
feel that we have got even with them. Every funeral procession carries a banner
upon which are written the words, "Equality of Mankind".

From this, then, a sense of human comedy and the very stuff of human poetry and
philosophy take their rise. He who perceives death perceives a sense of the
human comedy, and quickly becomes a poet. Shakespeare became a deep poet, when
he had Hamlet trace the noble dust of Alexander, "till he find it stopping a
bunghole":

> Alexander died,  
> Alexander was buried,  
> Alexander returned into dust,  
> The dust is earth,  
> Of earth we make loam,  
> And why of that loam,  
> Whereto he was converted,  
> Might they not stop a beer-barrel?

There is, after all, no more superb sense of comedy in Shakespeare than when he
let King Richard II talk of graves, of worms and epitaphs and the antic that
keeps court within the hollow crown that rounds the mortal temples of a king, or
where he speaks of "a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances,
his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries", with all his fines ending in a
"fine pate full of fine dirt". Omar Khayyarn and his Chinese counterpart, Chia
Fuhsi (***alias*** Mup'itse, an obscure Chinese poet), derived all their comic
spirit and comic interpretation of history from the sense of death itself, by
pointing to the foxes making their homes in the kings' graves. And Chinese
philosophy first acquired depth and humor with Chuantse, who based his entire
philosophy, too, on a comment on the sight of a skull:

> Chuangtse went to Ch'u and saw an empty skull with its empty and dried
> outline. He struck it with a horseship and asked it, "Hast thou come to this
> because thou loved pleasures and lived inordinately? ... Or wert thou starved
> to death? Or didst thou come to thy old age and die a natural death?" Having
> said this, Chuangtse took the skull and slept upon it as a pillow....

Thus I see both poetry and philosophy began with the recognition of our
mortality and a sense of the evanesence of time. This sense of life's evanesence
is back of all Chinese poetry, as well as of a good part of Western poetry, the
feeling that life is essentially but a dream, while we row, row our boat down
the river in the sunset of a beautiful afternoon, that flowers cannot bloom
forever, the moon maxes and wanes, and human life itself joins the eternal
procession of the plant and animal worlds in being born, growing to maturity and
dying to make room for others. Man began to be philosophical only when he saw
the vanity of this earthly existence. Chuangtse said that he once dreamed of
being a butterfly, and while he was in the dream, he felt he could flutter his
wings and everything was real, but that on waking up, he realized that he was
Chuangtse and Chuangtse was real. Then he thought and wondered which was really
real, whether he was really Chuangtse dreaming of being a butterfly, or really a
butterfly dreaming of being Chuangtse. Life, then, is really a dream, and we
human beings are like travelers floating down the eternal river of time,
embarking at a certain point and disembarking again at another point in order to
make room for others waiting below the river to come aboard. Half of the poetry
of life would be gone, if we did not feel that life was either a dream, or a
voyage with transient travelers, or merely a stage in which the actors seldom
realized that they were playing their parts. So wrote a Chinese scholar, Liu
Tasheng, to his friend:

> Of all the things in the world, that in which we are most earnest is to be an
> official, and that which we call the most frivolous is to be an actor in a
> play. But I think this is all foolishness. I have often seen on the stage how
> the actors sing and sweep and scold each other and crack jokes, believing that
> they are real people. But the real thing in a play is not the ancient
> characters thus being enacted, but rather these actor who enact them. They all
> have their parents, wives and children, all want to feed their parents, wives
> and children, and all do so by singing and weeping and laughing and scolding
> and cracking jokes. They are the real ancient characters that they try to
> portray. I have also seen how some of these actors, who wear an official cap
> and gown and by their own acting believe themselves to be real officials, so
> much so that they think no one in the world ever suspects they are acting.
> They do not realize that while they bow and kowtow to each other and sit and
> talk and look about, and even while they are dignified officials before whom
> the prisoners tremble, they are only actors who by their singing and weeping
> and laughing and scolding and cracking jokes are trying to feed their parents,
> wives and children! Alas! that there are people who stick to a certain play, a
> certain role, a certain text and a certain accent or style of delivery, until
> the entire asset of their bowels and internal organs (i.e, instincts and
> emotions) are dominated by the play, without realizing once that they are
> really actors!
